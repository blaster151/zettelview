## Note Templates System

### Decision: Implement Note Templates for Enhanced Productivity
**Context**: Users need a way to quickly create notes with consistent structures and predefined content. The current note creation process requires starting from scratch each time, which can be inefficient for users who create similar types of notes regularly.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Template system with predefined structures** - Provides ready-to-use templates for common note types
2. **Snippets system** - Simple text snippets for quick insertion
3. **Wizard-based note creation** - Step-by-step guided note creation
4. **No template system** - Users create notes from scratch (current state)

**Decision**: Implement a comprehensive template system because:
- Significantly improves productivity for users who create similar note types
- Provides consistency in note structure and formatting
- Self-contained improvement that enhances core note creation workflow
- Can be extended with custom templates and categories
- Supports the knowledge base concept with structured note types

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Create TypeScript interfaces for template structure and metadata
- Build default templates for common note types (meeting notes, project plans, research notes, etc.)
- Implement useTemplates hook for template management with localStorage persistence
- Create TemplateSelector component with search, categories, and preview
- Build SaveAsTemplate component for creating custom templates from existing notes
- Integrate template functionality into main app with keyboard shortcuts
- Add comprehensive test coverage for all template functionality

**Technical Details:**
- Template structure includes id, name, description, category, content, tags, and metadata
- Categories: general, project, meeting, research, personal, custom
- Default templates: meeting notes, project plan, research notes, daily journal, book notes, blank note
- Template content supports placeholders ({{title}}, {{date}}, {{time}})
- localStorage persistence for custom templates with usage statistics
- Search functionality across template names, descriptions, and tags
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+T for template selector, Ctrl+Shift+S for save as template
- Integration with existing note creation and editing workflow

**User Experience:**
- Template selector modal with category tabs and search
- Preview of template content and metadata
- Save current note as template with custom name and category
- Usage statistics to track most popular templates
- Seamless integration with existing note creation workflow
- Accessibility features and keyboard navigation 

## Collaborative Editing Foundation

### Decision: Implement Collaborative Editing Foundation for Multi-User Knowledge Base
**Context**: The stretch goals include "Collaborative editing" as a future phase feature. Implementing the foundation for real-time collaboration would significantly enhance the app's capabilities and bring it closer to production-ready status.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Full real-time collaboration system** - Complete WebSocket-based collaboration with server infrastructure
2. **Mock collaboration foundation** - Client-side foundation with mock services for demonstration
3. **Simple presence indicators** - Basic user presence without real-time editing
4. **No collaboration features** - Keep the app single-user focused

**Decision**: Implement a collaborative editing foundation with mock services because:
- Provides the architectural foundation for future real-time collaboration
- Demonstrates the user experience and interface for collaboration features
- Self-contained improvement that can be built incrementally
- Allows testing of collaboration concepts without server infrastructure
- Brings the app closer to production-ready knowledge base status

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Create TypeScript interfaces for collaboration data structures (User, Session, Operations, etc.)
- Build mock collaboration service with event-driven architecture
- Implement useCollaboration hook for state management and event handling
- Create CollaborationPanel component for session management and user presence
- Build UserCursors component for displaying remote user cursors
- Integrate collaboration functionality into main app with keyboard shortcuts
- Add comprehensive test coverage for all collaboration functionality

**Technical Details:**
- Collaboration interfaces: User, CollaborationSession, EditOperation, ConflictResolution, CollaborationState
- Mock service with localStorage-based session management and event system
- Real-time cursor tracking and user presence indicators
- Operation-based editing with conflict resolution framework
- Configurable collaboration settings (cursors, presence, auto-resolve conflicts)
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+C for collaboration panel
- Event-driven architecture for future WebSocket integration

**User Experience:**
- Collaboration panel with session management and user presence
- Visual indicators for online users and active collaboration
- Remote cursor display with user colors and names
- Session creation and joining with unique session IDs
- Real-time statistics and conflict resolution tracking
- Seamless integration with existing note editing workflow

**Future Extensions:**
- WebSocket integration for real-time synchronization
- Operational Transformation (OT) or CRDT for conflict resolution
- Server-side session management and user authentication
- File-level collaboration with granular permissions
- Collaborative graph view and AI features 

## Plugin System Foundation

### Decision: Implement Plugin System Foundation for Extensible Knowledge Base
**Context**: The stretch goals include "Plugin system or theming" as a future phase feature. Implementing a plugin system foundation would make the app extensible and customizable, allowing users to enhance functionality with custom plugins, themes, and integrations.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Full plugin marketplace** - Complete plugin ecosystem with discovery, installation, and management
2. **Plugin system foundation** - Core plugin architecture with basic management and mock store
3. **Simple theme system** - Basic theming without plugin architecture
4. **No plugin system** - Keep the app with fixed functionality

**Decision**: Implement a plugin system foundation with mock store because:
- Provides the architectural foundation for future plugin ecosystem
- Makes the app extensible and customizable
- Self-contained improvement that can be built incrementally
- Allows testing of plugin concepts without full marketplace infrastructure
- Brings the app closer to production-ready knowledge base status

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Create TypeScript interfaces for plugin system (Plugin, PluginManifest, PluginContext, etc.)
- Build plugin manager service with registration, lifecycle management, and hook system
- Implement usePlugins hook for React state management
- Create PluginManager component for plugin management and settings
- Build PluginStore component with mock marketplace and discovery
- Integrate plugin functionality into main app with keyboard shortcuts
- Add comprehensive test coverage for all plugin functionality

**Technical Details:**
- Plugin interfaces: Plugin, PluginManifest, PluginContext, PluginHook, PluginEvent, PluginRegistry
- Plugin manager with localStorage-based settings and event system
- Hook system for extensibility (event, note operations, UI interactions)
- Plugin categories: theme, feature, integration, utility
- Built-in plugins: dark theme, word count, export markdown
- Mock store with sample plugins (GitHub integration, mind map view, zen theme, LaTeX support, PDF export)
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+P for plugin manager
- Event-driven architecture for future real-time features

**User Experience:**
- Plugin manager with enable/disable, settings, and plugin information
- Plugin store with search, categories, and plugin discovery
- Plugin details modal with configuration options and installation
- Settings management for individual plugins
- Built-in plugins for immediate value
- Seamless integration with existing app functionality

**Future Extensions:**
- Real plugin marketplace with download and installation
- Plugin development SDK and documentation
- Plugin versioning and update system
- Plugin permissions and security model
- Plugin performance monitoring and analytics
- Plugin collaboration and sharing features

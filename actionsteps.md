## Development Loop #9 - Theme Support (Light/Dark Mode)

### Actions Taken:

1. **Analyzed Current State**
   - Reviewed `reqs.md` and `reqs-decisions.md` for unimplemented requirements
   - Identified that light/dark theme support was missing ("Support light/dark themes where possible")
   - Chose to implement a theme system as a self-contained, user-focused improvement

2. **Implementation**
   - Created a Zustand-based `themeStore` to manage theme state and provide color values
   - Defined comprehensive color palettes for both light and dark themes
   - Built a `ThemeToggle` component for switching themes, with accessible button and visual feedback
   - Updated `App.tsx` and `NoteSidebar.tsx` to use theme colors for backgrounds, text, borders, and buttons
   - Updated all relevant UI elements to use theme values for a consistent look
   - Added a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+T) and command palette entry for toggling theme
   - Integrated theme switching with smooth transitions

3. **Testing**
   - Added a comprehensive test suite for `ThemeToggle` covering:
     - Rendering in both light and dark modes
     - Accessibility attributes
     - Button styling and hover state
     - Icon/text correctness
     - Functionality of the toggle
   - Ran all tests to confirm no regressions

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated this `actionsteps.md` with details of the development loop
   - Ensured the new feature is discoverable via keyboard shortcut and command palette

### Status: âœ… Complete
- Theme support (light/dark mode) is fully implemented and integrated
- UI consistently adapts to theme changes
- Keyboard shortcut and command palette entry provided
- Comprehensive test coverage for the new feature

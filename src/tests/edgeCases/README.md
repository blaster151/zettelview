# Edge Case Test Suite for Note Chaining

This directory contains comprehensive edge case tests for the automated ID link chaining functionality. These tests ensure the system is robust, secure, and performs well under various edge conditions.

## Test Categories

### 1. Validation Tests (`validation.test.ts`)
Tests for input validation and boundary conditions:

- **Empty/Invalid Inputs**: Empty note IDs, null values, undefined properties
- **Special Characters**: Unicode, HTML entities, special regex characters
- **Extreme Values**: Very long titles, large tag arrays, boundary conditions
- **ID Generation Edge Cases**: Counter overflow, timestamp collisions, format validation
- **Title Generation Edge Cases**: Missing variables, empty formats, complex patterns

### 2. Concurrency Tests (`concurrency.test.ts`)
Tests for race conditions and simultaneous operations:

- **Simultaneous Note Creation**: Multiple chained notes created at the same time
- **Cross-Chain Operations**: Operations on different chains concurrently
- **Race Conditions**: ID generation under concurrent access
- **Chain Registry Concurrency**: Registry operations during concurrent access
- **Async Error Handling**: Error scenarios during concurrent operations

### 3. Error Handling Tests (`errorHandling.test.ts`)
Tests for error scenarios and recovery mechanisms:

- **Service Failures**: Logging service, notification service failures
- **Store Failures**: Database/store operation failures
- **Validation Errors**: Invalid options, malformed data
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Temporary failures, partial success scenarios
- **Error Propagation**: Error callback handling, async error scenarios

### 4. Performance Tests (`performance.test.ts`)
Tests for performance under various conditions:

- **Large Datasets**: 1000+ chained notes, multiple chains
- **Memory Management**: Memory leaks, garbage collection scenarios
- **Concurrent Operations**: Performance under concurrent load
- **Chain Registry Performance**: Large chain lookups, cleanup operations
- **ID Generation Performance**: Large counters, different formats
- **Title Generation Performance**: Complex formats, large titles

### 5. Security Tests (`security.test.ts`)
Tests for security vulnerabilities and input sanitization:

- **Input Sanitization**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection attempts
- **Data Validation**: Strict format validation, malicious inputs
- **Chain Registry Security**: Malicious chain IDs, note IDs
- **ID Generation Security**: Malicious prefixes, format injection
- **Title Generation Security**: Template injection, malicious formats
- **Data Integrity**: Corruption prevention, consistency under attack

### 6. Async Tests (`async.test.ts`)
Tests for asynchronous operation handling:

- **Promise Handling**: Rejections, timeouts, race conditions, cancellation
- **Async Error Recovery**: Temporary failures, partial failures
- **Concurrent Async Operations**: Multiple async operations simultaneously
- **Async State Management**: State consistency during async operations
- **Async Callback Handling**: Async callbacks, error scenarios
- **Async Resource Management**: Resource cleanup, memory management

```

## Test Patterns

### Mocking Strategy
- Store operations are mocked to simulate various failure scenarios
- Services are mocked to test error handling
- Async operations are controlled to test timing and race conditions

### Assertion Patterns
- **Success Cases**: Verify expected behavior under normal conditions
- **Failure Cases**: Verify graceful handling of errors and invalid inputs
- **Performance Cases**: Verify operations complete within acceptable time limits
- **Security Cases**: Verify malicious inputs are handled safely

### Test Data
- **Valid Data**: Normal note objects with standard properties
- **Invalid Data**: Null, undefined, malformed, or malicious inputs
- **Boundary Data**: Extremely long strings, large arrays, edge case values
- **Concurrent Data**: Multiple operations with overlapping data

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Tests are organized by functional area and edge case type
- Each test focuses on a specific scenario or condition
- Test names clearly describe the scenario being tested
- Related tests are grouped in describe blocks

### Test Reliability
- Tests are independent and can run in any order
- Proper cleanup is performed between tests
- Mocks are reset to prevent test interference
- Async operations are properly awaited

### Test Maintainability
- Common test data is defined once and reused
- Mock setup is consistent across test files
- Error scenarios are clearly documented
- Performance expectations are realistic

## Continuous Integration

These edge case tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:

- **Fast Execution**: Tests complete within reasonable time limits
- **Reliable Results**: Tests produce consistent, deterministic results
- **Clear Failures**: Test failures provide clear information about what went wrong
- **Coverage Reporting**: Test coverage helps identify gaps in testing

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for additional edge case testing:

- **Internationalization**: Unicode normalization, RTL text, various languages
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation edge cases
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Touch interactions, viewport size changes
- **Offline Scenarios**: Network disconnection, sync conflicts
- **Data Migration**: Version upgrades, schema changes
- **Plugin Integration**: Third-party plugin interactions and conflicts
